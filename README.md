# ZTag

ZTag is a utility that works in conjunction with ZMap and ZGrab and allows 
annotating raw scan data with additional metadata (e.g., device models and 
vulnerabilities) and transforming records. ZTag is used extensively within
Censys (https://www.censys.io) to produce the data present in the search
engine. However, it can also be run independently with ZMap and ZGrab.
